Today I want to introduce the ["Practice Go"](https://github.com/plutov/practice-go), a collection of different Go exercises. Every week I will post/push a new exercise without a solution, so anyone can solve it via PR. I will select the fastest and more elegant solution and merge it into the master. If my solution is better, I will post it :)

### Exercise 1: Chess

You can find a Chess exercise [here](https://github.com/plutov/practice-go/tree/master/chess) and you have a week to solve it.

It's a Go time!
