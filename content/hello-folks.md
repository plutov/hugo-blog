#### Let me introduce myself

I started my blogging with Russian content at [plutov.by](http://plutov.by "plutov.by"). Then I decided to share my thoughts in English to reach more people interested in this stuff.

Currently I live and work in Saigon. Here we have an eCommerce project [Lazada](https://lazada.com "lazada.com") where I work as Team Lead in DevOps team.

#### What shall I post?
Materials, examples, thoughts about Go, DevOps, PHP, CI/CD, open source and more.
