I'm really enjoying to share some stuff about Golang and related technologies. I am blogging here and also on [dev.to](https://dev.to/plutov).

But I want to try the new way to share things, by doing live streams or record a videos where I'll share my screen and we can implement together some interesting functionality.

So I just created a channel [packagemain](https://www.youtube.com/packagemain) where I share the following topics:
 - Programming in Go
 - Go code review
 - Solving Algorithms with Go
 - Implement Bots with NLP
 - Performance optimizations

Let me know if you want to see something else.
