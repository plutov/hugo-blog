I'm a senior backend engineer with over 8 years of experience, currently working mostly with Go and Microservices, applying [twelve-factor](https://12factor.net/) methodology. I've worked at both small and large companies bringing products from concept
to release in a variety of environments.

Recently I started my YouTube [channel](https://www.youtube.com/packagemain) about programming in Go ðŸ“¹.

If you think I'm a good fit for your organization, please drop an email at [mailto:a.pliutau@gmail.com](a.pliutau@gmail.com).
