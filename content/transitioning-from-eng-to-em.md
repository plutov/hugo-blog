A couple of months ago I moved from a Team Lead position to being an engineering manager at Wizeline Vietnam on a small sized team. I've found this role change come with a mindset change, something what mattered before when I was an individual contributor (writing good code, apply best engineering practices) became less important. On the other hand, other things became more important, like team health, team success and team career growth.

In this post I will summarize what worked well for me during the early phase of this transition.

### Now my successes will be usually achieved through others

It's all about the work behind the scenes to put engineers in position to succeed and highlight their successes, while we stay in the shadow.

Most engineering managers were successful engineers first. Losing that can hurt, but being a manager offers a chance to have a bigger impact, on peopleâ€™s lives as well. And many managers find that helping others helps them grow, too.

### Mentoring is important

I was working at Wizeline for more than a year when this transition has started. And I believe that a successful manager needs to understand core elements of the company culture and values, including what makes the startup uniquely successful and what steps it needs to take next.

Fortuantely, I had a good mentor and had a time for the onboarding, not all new managers have this opportunity. But it's very important to have independent advice, from a birds eye view. However, given my mentor is within the company, Wizeline also give me a lot of insight and ideas that are specific to the environment I'm working in. It's hard to see the effect of mentorship the short term, but it already gives me additional confidence to have someone I trust provide me with regular and candid feedback.

### Set goals

One of roles as engineering manager is to help engineers set goals that grow them professionally. It takes time to understand priorities and goals of people on my team.

I went through 1:1 with everyone on my team. The only person I forgot to do it was myself. But my manager reminded me that I also should come up with short and long term goals.

### Time / task management

I didn't have too many meetings when I was an individual contributor. However, as manager, I do have far more meetings than before, 1:1s, team meetings, etc. But I always put free slots into my calendar every week to be able to digest information I've got, or simply focus on something.

It's very important to keep track on your tasks and don't let them be forgotten. Everyone has own technique to manage tasks, and if something works for me, it doesn't mean that it'll work for someone else.

I started to experiment with GSD process that already works better than my original ad hoc approach I did when I was an individual controbutor.

### Start with yourself

Self clear vision, short ang long term goals.

Most people find it harder to be humble when they're mad, hungry or tired. If I focus on managing my emotions it's easier for me to prevent my ego from getting the better of me. Ask yourself what you need to stay centered, and make sure to do those things to take care of yourself.

If you feel sad, it's maybe better to stay at home for a day and don't spread your mental desease in the office.
