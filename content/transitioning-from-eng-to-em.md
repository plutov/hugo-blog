A couple of months ago I moved from a Team Lead position to being an engineering manager at Wizeline Vietnam on a small sized team. I've found this role change come with a mindset change, something what mattered before when I was an individual contributor (writing good code, apply best engineering practices) became less important. On the other hand, other things became more important, like team health, team success and team career growth.

In this post I will summarize what worked well for me during the early phase of this transition.

### Now my successes will be usually achieved through others

It's all about the work behind the scenes to put engineers in position to succeed and highlight their successes, while we stay in the shadow.

Most engineering managers were successful engineers first. Losing that can hurt, but being a manager offers a chance to have a bigger impact, on peopleâ€™s lives as well. And many managers find that helping others helps them grow, too.

### Mentoring is important

I was working at Wizeline for more than a year when this transition has started.
