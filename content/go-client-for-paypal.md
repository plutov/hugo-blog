### Clients in Go

There are official SDK libraries for PHP, Java and Python, but our service is written in GO, and in this case SDK search mostly [fails](https://github.com/search?q=paypal+golang "GitHub"). As a result we have found five projects on github, two of which seem worthily, but at the same time they have bounded functional:

* [leebenson/paypal](https://github.com/leebenson/paypal "leebenson/paypal")
* [crowdmob/paypal](https://github.com/crowdmob/paypal "crowdmob/paypal")

### Contribute to Open Source

So we decided to make a native client in Go with 100% API coverage.
