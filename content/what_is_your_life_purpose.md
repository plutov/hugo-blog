Each of us has a story. Own your story, it's yours. Don't pretend to be something you are not. Worrying about what people think blocks us from being real and unique. But being real is the highest truth.

People around us have a big influence over what we think and how we behave. But we need sometimes to distance ourselves from those influences and have times of silence so we can hear our true voice. That will help us to understand our life purpose.

And remember that realizing your purpose is not so hard. The hard part is keeping it with you every single day and working on yourself to to become that purpose.
