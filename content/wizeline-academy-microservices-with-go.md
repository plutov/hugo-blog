What I like about Wizeline is that we have an amazing [Academy](https://www.facebook.com/WizelineAcademy/), both internal and public. Yesterday I was in Mexico, Guadalajara office of Wizeline and I was doing a workshop about Microservices with Go.

The idea was to tell people about SOA approach, gRPC, Protocol Buffers and code a fictional application based on these principles in Go.

I am happy with results, especially when I saw how talented people are, even with new language for them.

We committed our work into this [repository](https://github.com/wizelineacademy/GoWorkshop) and made a [live streaming](https://www.facebook.com/WizelineAcademy/videos/1726299830998775/). Check it out!

Now I am going back to Vietnam and we will start doing Academy there, stay tuned!
