 - Log an error or return it, don't do both.
 - `defer` is slow.
 - Use `iota` in constants if the value doesn't matter.
 - It is not required to close an unused channel. If no goroutine is left referencing the channel, it will be garbage collected. it is only necessary to close a channel if the receiver is looking for a close.
 - Consider structuring your program so that only one goroutine at a time is ever responsible for a particular piece of data.
 - Always run your tests with race detector.
 - Use `%+v` to print the error with sufficient detail.
 - Declare type's methods on *T.
 - Go maps are not goroutine safe, you must use a sync.Mutex, sync.RWMutex to ensure reads and writes are properly synchronised.
 - Channel axioms: a send to a nil channel blocks forever, a receive from a nil channel blocks forever, a send to a closed channel panics, a receive from a closed channel returns the zero value immediately.
