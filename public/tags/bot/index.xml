      <description>Building a Slack Bot with Go and Wit.ai This is a text version of this video: packagemain #9: Building Slack Bot with Go and Wit.ai.
We will build a simple Slack Bot with NLU functionality to get some useful information from Wolfram. No worries if you didn&amp;rsquo;t use Wolfram before, it&amp;rsquo;s a computational knowledge engine which can give you a short answer to your question.
There are different platforms for NLU, such as LUIS.</description>

      <description>At Wizeline we have Python courses, and recent topic was how to build a Bot in Python. I always wanted to try Natural Language Understanding (NLU) as a subtopic of natural language processing in artificial intelligence that deals with machine reading comprehension.
As we use Python, I checked which libraries we already have to do it and I decided to try RASA NLU, a tool for understanding what is being said in short pieces of text.</description>
