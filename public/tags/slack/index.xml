      <description>Building a Slack Bot with Go and Wit.ai This is a text version of this video: packagemain #9: Building Slack Bot with Go and Wit.ai.
We will build a simple Slack Bot with NLU functionality to get some useful information from Wolfram. No worries if you didn&amp;rsquo;t use Wolfram before, it&amp;rsquo;s a computational knowledge engine which can give you a short answer to your question.
There are different platforms for NLU, such as LUIS.</description>

      <description>I am enjoying writing programs in a short time, like in a Hackathon way. Here in Vietnam we don&amp;rsquo;t have Hackathons often, so yesterday I decided to make one for myself with a time limit in 3 hours. The goal was to build/deploy something that will work and people can try it. I decided to go with Bot for Slack (or another messenger in the future).
So I wrote this Stranger Bot to meet strangers in your Slack, explore new people.</description>
