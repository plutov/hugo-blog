      <description>This is a text version of this video: packagemain #5: Face Detection in Go using OpenCV and MachineBox.
I found a very nice developer-friendly project MachineBox, which provides some machine learning tools inside Docker Container, including face detection, natural language understanding and few more. And it has SDK in Go, so we will build a program which will detect my face. We will also use OpenCV to capture video from Web camera, it also has Go bindings.</description>

      <description>This is a text version of this video: packagemain #4: Image Recognition in Go using Tensorflow.
Tensorflow is a computation library that represents computations with graphs. Its core is implemented in C++ and there are also bindings for different languages, including Go.
In the last few years the field of machine learning has made tremendous progress on addressing the difficult problem of image recognition.
One of the challenges with machine learning is figuring out how to deploy trained models into production environments.</description>
