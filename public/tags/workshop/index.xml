      <description>What I like about Wizeline is that we have an amazing Academy, both internal and public. Yesterday I was in Mexico, Guadalajara office of Wizeline and I was doing a workshop about Microservices with Go.
The idea was to tell people about SOA approach, gRPC, Protocol Buffers and code a fictional application based on these principles in Go.
I am happy with results, especially when I saw how talented people are, even with new language for them.</description>
