      <description>Hi, folks!
Last Saturday I was very inspired by Alexa skills using server-side Swift talk organized by Wizeline Vietnam team. Speakers made a demo of how can we use Alex Skill in League of Legends (LoL). This Skill enables a user to retrieve the statistics of the enemy team mid-match using voice-enabled commands.
I went home with an idea of building a game, fully based on voice recognition, without any interface.</description>
