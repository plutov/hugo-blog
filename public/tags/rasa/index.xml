      <description>At Wizeline we have Python courses, and recent topic was how to build a Bot in Python. I always wanted to try Natural Language Understanding (NLU) as a subtopic of natural language processing in artificial intelligence that deals with machine reading comprehension.
As we use Python, I checked which libraries we already have to do it and I decided to try RASA NLU, a tool for understanding what is being said in short pieces of text.</description>
