      <description>This is a text version of this video: packagemain #4: Image Recognition in Go using Tensorflow.
Tensorflow is a computation library that represents computations with graphs. Its core is implemented in C++ and there are also bindings for different languages, including Go.
In the last few years the field of machine learning has made tremendous progress on addressing the difficult problem of image recognition.
One of the challenges with machine learning is figuring out how to deploy trained models into production environments.</description>
